Step 1: Data Generation and Initial Assessment
In this step, we've created a synthetic dataset simulating account information, predicted gender probabilities, actual gender labels, and whether an account holder responded positively to an AI-based product. Two visualizations are included:

Distribution of Gender Prediction Scores:
This plot shows how strongly the gender prediction model differentiates between genders. Ideally, predictions should clearly separate groups without excessive overlap.

Mean AI Product Response by True Gender:
This bar plot indicates the average response rates split by actual gender. A noticeable difference between genders suggests possible bias in how the AI product responds or assigns opportunities.

These visuals set the stage by clearly illustrating whether the initial conditions might suggest potential gender bias.

Step 2: Monte Carlo Simulation for Bias Assessment
To rigorously assess bias, we've implemented a Monte Carlo simulation. In this approach, we repeatedly simulate possible gender assignments based on predicted probabilities and measure differences in product responses between groups.

Distribution of Monte Carlo Bias Metric:
This histogram illustrates the simulated differences in response rates between genders over numerous trials. If the distribution is centered significantly away from zero, it indicates strong evidence of bias favoring one gender.
This method provides a statistically robust measure of whether observed differences in outcomes are due to genuine bias rather than random chance.

Step 3: Confidence Interval Estimation (Bootstrap Method)
In Step 3, we've employed a bootstrap technique, which repeatedly resamples our dataset to quantify the uncertainty around our bias measurement. The result is a confidence interval—represented visually and numerically—that provides clarity on the reliability of our bias conclusions.

Bootstrap Distribution of Bias Metrics:
The plot demonstrates how consistent our bias measurement is across many resamples. The narrower and more clearly separated from zero the interval is, the greater confidence we can have that bias genuinely exists.
If the confidence interval clearly does not include zero, we have strong statistical confirmation that our AI model is biased, necessitating immediate review or adjustments.



Narrative for Sensitivity Analysis (Step 4):
The purpose of the sensitivity analysis is to evaluate if our bias conclusions remain consistent when we vary our assumptions—in this case, the concentration parameter of the Beta distribution, which controls the uncertainty in our gender predictions.

In the visual plot provided, you'll see the concentration parameter on the horizontal axis and the mean bias metric on the vertical axis. Ideally, you want to see a relatively flat line—this indicates your bias conclusions are stable and reliable across different uncertainty assumptions. If the line significantly fluctuates as the concentration parameter changes, it suggests your conclusions are sensitive and less robust, indicating that the bias assessment might need further refinement or additional data validation.

A stable (flat) trend gives confidence that the identified bias (or lack thereof) is genuinely reflective of the AI product behavior and not just an artifact of assumptions used in the analysis.
